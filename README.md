## JAVA
#### Introduction
Java is oriented programming language which show the principle "write once, run anywhere"(WORA)- Java application can be executed any platform where Java Virtual Machine(JVM) is installed.
Some popular applications of java can be listed like :
 + large client-server web
 + modern desktop
 + mobile applications
 + frameworks
 + libraries

Some essential properties of Java :
* platform independence : compiler convert source code to bytecode after that JVM executes the bytecode.
* multi-paradigm: almost everything is an object of a class.
* **garbage collector** : automatics memory cleaning of unused object at runtime.
* built-in multithreading : concurrent and parallel execution of several parts of Java program.

#### Translate Java source code :(basic understand)
* Tools   :-------------javac----------------------JVM-------------
* process : FILE.java ---> FILE.class(bytecode) ---> low-level code ---> computer



### Compile java code in Terminal
> javac NameClass.java
> java NameClass


### Some shortcut must remember when using intellij
* Ctrl + Space // quick
* Ctrl + j //
* Ctrl + q // View the doc about the function
* Ctrl + Alt + L // format code

### Install third party library : the spring libraries
Class path: consist of one or more directories that contain all the Java files associated with our project.

Now, I add JAR(Java Archive) files to class path in intellij:
Using Gradle or Maven to manage the dependence


### Import for write code
* java.io...  or java.util.... // for input and output
*


## Spring
https://spring.io/

Spring is a library for creating interactive web applications.hl

Basic web app operation: Client request to server through the web browser (protocol define the rule is HTTP : Hyper Text Transfer Protocol).  Some basic components when we start Java code such as : a component to intercept the incoming request, component to handle the request to certain locations and more components to fetch and store any data related to the requester response, the components to generate the response back to the web browser. The code will define the logic for responding the web requests and it executes in a web server.

Therefore, the approach here is using the popular of java is the spring framework.
